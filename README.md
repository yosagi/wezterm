## Getting help

This is a spare time project, so please bear with me.  There are a couple of channels for support:

* You can use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/issues) to see if someone else has a similar issue, or to file a new one.
* Start or join a thread in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/discussions); if you have general
  questions or want to chat with other wezterm users, you're welcome here!
* There is a [Matrix room via Element.io](https://app.element.io/#/room/#wezterm:matrix.org)
  for (potentially!) real time discussions.

The GitHub Discussions and Element/Gitter rooms are better suited for questions
than bug reports, but don't be afraid to use whichever you are most comfortable
using and we'll work it out.
